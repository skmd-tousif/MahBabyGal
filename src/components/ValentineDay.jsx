        Even though 844.44345 miles separate us,
        my heart feels closest to you today.

      <p>
        Honestly I don't need special days like this to miss you more because i do so each and every moment.
        Still, Since today the entire surrounding around you will be so lovey dovey, remember i miss you for the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss you, but loving you from afar
        still makes every day special.
